 # Introduction
 The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the global healthcare system and economy. One of the critical issues in managing the pandemic is accurately predicting the spread of the virus. A predictive model that can forecast the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths can help healthcare professionals and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, public health measures, and vaccination strategies. The main objective of this project is to develop a model for Covid-19. The development of this model will have significant implications for public health policy and management. It can assist policymakers in identifying the most effective interventions to control the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact on healthcare systems and the economy. The model can also serve as a valuable reference for researchers and policymakers in developing and implementing early warning systems for detecting and containing potential outbreaks.

# Dataset and Methodology:
For this project, I have used an open-source dataset available on Kaggle [1]. The dataset contains a total of 306429 observations of Covid case data from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021. The dataset has columns named ‘observation data’, ‘province/state’, ‘country/region’, ‘covid confirmed date, ‘cumulative death’,  and ‘cumulative recovered’.

The project is divided into two phases to analyze the COVID-19 dataset. In the first phase, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis is used to gain insights into the data. Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points into clusters based on their distance or similarity. This technique helps to uncover the underlying structure of the data and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent. The dendrogram produced by hierarchical clustering can also provide a visual representation of the relationships between data points and clusters, which can aid in interpreting the results.

In the second phase of the project, time series analysis methods are implemented to forecast the spread of the pandemic. Since the dataset is a time series dataset, time series analysis techniques are best suited for analyzing and predicting the trend over time. Exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters time series methods are used to explore the dataset and identify trends and patterns in the data. Exponential smoothing is a popular time series method that can be used to identify and forecast trends, seasonal patterns, and irregular fluctuations in the data. Holt-Winters is another time series method that is used to forecast future values based on trends and seasonal patterns in the data. 

# Result Analysis: 
### Hierarchical Clustering: 
The dataset contains Covid-19 ‘Confirmed’, ‘Deaths’, and ‘Recovered’ cases from different regions of the world. To analyze the data region wise the data is grouped by ‘Country/Region’ and aggregated the total number of cases. There are in total 229 ‘Country/Region’ in the dataset. To illustrate clearly in a dendrogram top 20 County/Region is taken and depicted in Fig2. For hierarchical clustering, the ‘ward’ linkage method is used. It aims to minimize the sum of squared differences within all clusters, which leads to clusters that are compact and well-separated from each other. Using the agglomerative coefficient, 5 clusters are chosen for this dataset. For 5 clusters the agglomerative coefficient is  0.99 and for the top 20 ‘Country/Region’ the coefficient is 0.94. The agglomerative coefficient is a measure of the quality of the clustering result produced by agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms such as Ward's method. It ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher degree of clustering. The agglomerative coefficient is calculated based on the dendrogram produced by the clustering algorithm and reflects the degree of similarity between the different clusters at each step of the agglomerative process. Here in Fig 2, we can see that ‘US’ is in a separate cluster, and ‘India’, and ‘Brazil’ are in another cluster. European countries such as ‘France’, ‘Spain’ and ‘UK’ are in one cluster.

### Forecasting with Time-Series: 
Forecasting with time series is an important aspect of analytics. There are four components of time series: trend, seasonal, cyclical, and random [2]. To analyze trends and seasonality in the dataset Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing are implemented. Before implementing time series methods the data is grouped by ‘ObservationDate’ and aggregated the total number of cases. There is a total 494 number of observations. 

### Exponential Smoothing (ETS): 
Exponential Smoothing is an important technique for trend analysis in time series forecasting because it is a flexible and powerful method that can capture various types of trends in data. For the analysis data is taken from January 22, 2020, to May 28, 2021. Excluded last day (May 29, 2021) to verify the forecasted value. Data is fit into 2 separate ets() methods. For the user-specified method ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’ are chosen at 0.4 and 0.3 respectively. The parameter ‘alpha’ controls the level smoothing in the model and ‘beta’ controls the trend smoothing in the model. To give more weight to recent observations higher values are chosen. Table 1 shows the result of ETS. The ME can be negative if the forecast values are consistently higher than the actual values, resulting in negative forecast errors. Here, it indicates that the model tends to over-predict the values. If we observe the RMSE value of the test dataset, we can conclude that the system default ets() method is working better. To forecast the last day of the dataset, the model predicted the number of confirmed cases is 21094507 whereas the actual number is 169951560.

### Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing: 
The Holt-winter exponential smoothing method is also known as the triple exponential smoothing method. It can integrate the long-term upward and downward movements of time series as well as seasonality [2]. By analyzing the result of ETS we can say that that model is not able to capture the trend as expected. To analyze the seasonality in the data Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing is implemented. The frequency is set to 12 and excluded from the last month (May 2021) to verify the forecasted value from the model. Table 2 depicts the result of Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing. From the table, we can say that the accuracy function shows that both models have similar accuracy measures, indicating that the choice of seasonality assumption (additive vs. multiplicative) does not have a significant impact on the forecasting performance for this particular dataset. The "AAA" model stands for Additive Error, Additive Trend, and Additive Seasonality. It is used when the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations is independent of the level of the time series. The "AAM" model stands for Additive Error, Additive Trend, and Multiplicative Seasonality. It is used when the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations is proportional to the level of the time series. To forecast the last month of the dataset, the model predicted the number of confirmed cases is 95225317 whereas the actual number is 95128170. The model almost acutely predicts the number.

## Alternative Approaches: 
Instead of hierarchical clustering K-means clustering could be used. Hierarchical clustering is advantageous because it provides a hierarchical structure of clusters that allows users to visualize the relationships between clusters and understand how they are nested within each other. Hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance, as it can be determined from the dendrogram. k-means clustering is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets well but the dataset used for this project is not very large. For time series analysis, the most popular Moving Average Smoothing technique could be used.  ETS and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing take into account the trend and seasonality in the data, while moving average smoothing only considers the trend. 

# Conclusion: 
The Covid-19 pandemic has posed immense challenges to the healthcare systems and economies of countries across the world. The developed predictive model can forecast the spread of COVID-19. For this project, an open-source dataset is used which is available on Kaggle and contains a total of 306,429 observations of COVID-19 case data from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021. The project is divided into two phases. In the first phase, hierarchical clustering is used to gain insights into the data. In the second phase, time series analysis methods are implemented to forecast the spread of the pandemic. Exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters time series methods are used to explore the dataset and identify trends and patterns in the data. The developed models can assist policymakers in identifying the most effective interventions to control the spread of pandemic and mitigate its impact on healthcare systems and the economy. However, it should be noted that the model developed in this project is based on historical data, and future outcomes may depend on various factors, such as the emergence of new variants, vaccination rates, and public health policies. Therefore, continuous monitoring and updating of the model with new data and information is necessary to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting the spread of the pandemic.
